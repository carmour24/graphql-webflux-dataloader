/**
 * An object representing the context of a single HTTP request (e.g. a GraphQL request). Passed from the GraphQL
 * entry points to the resolvers by storing it in the [ExecutionInput.context]. This allows the resolvers to then
 * retrieve it by calling the [DataFetchingEnvironment.getContext] method (though an extension method exists to get this
 * more directly: see [DataFetchingEnvironment.requestContext]
 *
 * The primary use of this object is to provide access to the [DataLoaderRegistry] so that the resolvers have access to
 * the (request-scoped) data loaders.
 *
 * @property dataLoaderRegistry The registry of data loaders which provides access to the data loaders.
