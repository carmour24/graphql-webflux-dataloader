/**
 * Aggregates information about a query being executed, for example the instances of all the aliased tables. Provides
 * functionality for getting at the name to refer to a field by (its alias), based on the (aliased) table it belongs to.
 *
 * The need for storing the aliases rather than just calculating them on the fly in some way is caused by the fact that
 * there is a default 64 byte limit for field (and alias) names in Postgres (see
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS), which can be reached
 * if enough tables are joined, so instead we assign shorter aliases and store them here.
 *
 * Additionally, when JOOQ generates SQL, it will generate SQL such as "SELECT A.X, B.X..." - i.e. two columns which have
 * the same column name. When we retrieve data from the query using the reactive-pg-client libraries, we do this by the
 * column name, so we need a unique name to be generated.
 *
 * @param sourceTable The the main table which the query starts with. This is immediately aliased and added to the list
 * of table instances in this query
